    sampling edges based on their membership strength (with the (1-p) terms
    coming from negative sampling similar to word2vec).
    Parameters
    ----------
    head_embedding: array of shape (n_samples, n_components)
        The initial embedding to be improved by SGD.
    tail_embedding: array of shape (source_samples, n_components)
        The reference embedding of embedded points. If not embedding new
        previously unseen points with respect to an existing embedding this
        is simply the head_embedding (again); otherwise it provides the
        existing embedding to embed with respect to.
    head: array of shape (n_1_simplices)
        The indices of the heads of 1-simplices with non-zero membership.
    tail: array of shape (n_1_simplices)
        The indices of the tails of 1-simplices with non-zero membership.
    n_epochs: int
        The number of training epochs to use in optimization.
    n_vertices: int
        The number of vertices (0-simplices) in the dataset.
    epochs_per_samples: array of shape (n_1_simplices)
        A float value of the number of epochs per 1-simplex. 1-simplices with
        weaker membership strength will have more epochs between being sampled.
    a: float
        Parameter of differentiable approximation of right adjoint functor
    b: float
        Parameter of differentiable approximation of right adjoint functor
    rng_state: array of int64, shape (3,)
        The internal state of the rng
    gamma: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Weight to apply to negative samples.
    initial_alpha: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Initial learning rate for the SGD.
    negative_sample_rate: int (optional, default 5)
        Number of negative samples to use per positive sample.
    parallel: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to run the computation using numba parallel.
        Running in parallel is non-deterministic, and is not used
        if a random seed has been set, to ensure reproducibility.
    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to report information on the current progress of the algorithm.
    Returns
    -------
    embedding: array of shape (n_samples, n_components)
        The optimized embedding.
